        Question: In a given population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele, b. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which of the following is the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer?
        Choices:
        (A) 1/400
        (B) 19/400
        (C) 20/400
        (D) 38/400
        Let's think step by step:  The expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer equals to the frequency of heterozygous allele in the given population. According to the Hardy-Weinberg equation p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1, where p is the frequency of dominant allele frequency, q is the frequency of recessive allele frequency, p^2 is the frequency of the homozygous dominant allele, q^2 is the frequency of the recessive allele, and 2pq is the frequency of the heterozygous allele. Given that q^2=1/400, hence, q=0.05 and p=1-q=0.95. The frequency of the heterozygous allele is 2pq=2*0.05*0.95=38/400. The final answer is (D).

        Question: A Fe pellet of 0.056 g is first dissolved in 10 mL of hydrobromic acid HBr (0.1 M). The resulting solution is then titrated by KMnO4 (0.02 M). How many equivalence points are there?
        Choices:
        (A) Two points, 25 ml and 35 ml
        (B) One point, 25 mL
        (C) One point, 10 ml
        (D) Two points, 25 ml and 30 ml
        Let's think step by step:  HBr will react with Fe to produce Fe2+. MnO4- will first react with Fe2+ then Br-. Two equivalence points will exist 25 ml and 35 ml. In the beaker there is Fe2+ and Br-. When considering titration with two analytes one will have to consider which reaction will occur first. Since it is a redox titration consider the reduction potential of: E0 (Br2 /Br- ) = 1.09 V  \tE0 (MnO4-/ Mn2+) = 1.49 V\tE0 (Fe3+/Fe2+) =0.77 V. [Fe2+]=m/MV=0.1M. Reaction 1: MnO4- + 5Fe2+ + 8H+ \u2192 Mn2+ + 5Fe3+ + 4H2O. Reaction 2: 2MnO4- + 10Br- + 16H+ \u2192 2Mn2+ + 5Br2 + 8H2O. So MnO4- will first react with Fe2+ with a stoichiometry of 1:5 so Veq1 will be 10 ml. Then when Fe2+ is used up, MnO4- will react with Br- with a stoichiometry of 2:10 then V added will be 25 ml so Veq2=25+10=35 ml. The final answer is (A).

        Question: Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \u03c9^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hooke's law. Here, $\u03c9$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the origin in spherical polar coordinates. What is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?
        Choices:
        (A) 11 \u03c0\u00b2 \u210f\u00b2 / (2m r\u00b2), 3
        (B) (9/2) \u210f \u03c9, 10
        (C) 11 \u03c0\u00b2 \u210f\u00b2 / (2m r\u00b2), 10
        (D) (9/2) \u210f \u03c9, 3
        Let's think step by step:  This problem is nothing but the three-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) problem. The energy spectrum of three-dimensional SHO is $E_n= (n+3/2)\u210f \u03c9$ where $n=0,1,2,3\u2026$. For third excited state n=3. 3+3/2=6/2+3/2=9/2. Thus the corresponding energy is $(9/2)\u210f \u03c9$. The degeneracy of the state is $g_n= (n+1)(n+2)/2$. For n=3, degeneracy is (3+1)*(3+2)/2=4*5/2=10. The final answer is (B).

        Question: Your overhear two chemists talking to each other as they leave a synthetic organic chemistry lab. One asks the other 'So, how did it go?' The second chemist replies, 'Not well - my compounds are on top of each other.' What is the second chemist most likely referring to?
        Choices:
        (A) The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.
        (B) The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.
        (C) The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.
        (D) The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.
        Let's think step by step:  On top of each other commonly refers to two compounds that have similar Rf values on chromatography (a common operation in synthetic chemistry). Similar Rf values arise for compounds with similar polarities. The final answer is (A).

        Question: Two people are playing the following game. A fair coin is tossed into the air. Person A says that in a single toss of the coin, the tail will come. So it's like the first shot or the third shot or the fifth shot. Person B says that the coin will come with a double toss. So like the second, fourth, sixth or eighth shot. Imagine this game played forever. What is the probability that person A wins this game?
        Choices:
        (A) 1/2
        (B) 1/4
        (C) 2/3
        (D) 1/8
        Let's think step by step:  When finding the correct answer, the probability of playing forever and the coin's single-point toss will be calculated. For example, a tail may appear on the first shot. This probability is 1/2. if the first toss doesn't come up, it shouldn't come to the second roll either, because the second throw is an even number. So it can come in the third shot. This is (1/2)(1/2)(1/2). So (1/2)^3=1/8. Or it could come on the fifth shot. This is (1/2)^5=1/32. This is actually a geometric series that goes on forever. We can write this series as follows. (1/2) + (1/2)^3 + (1/2)^5 + (1/2)^7 + \u2026\u2026\u2026. The solution for this series is as follows : a1/(1-r) where a1 is the first number and r is the sequence or r= a2/a1 or a3/a2 etc. a1=1/2 r=(1/2)^2=1/4 So a1/(1-r)=(1/2)/(1-1/4)=(1/2)/(3/4)=2/3. The final answer is (C).

        Question: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?
        Choices:
        (A) 10^-9 eV
        (B) 10^-11 eV
        (C) 10^-8 eV
        (D) 10^-4 eV
